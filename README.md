## Analysis Summary:
The analysis provided information about the district and charter school summaries, including total schools, total students, total budget, average math and reading scores, and the percentages of students passing math, reading, and overall. Additionally, it included details about each school, such as school type, total students per school, school budget, per student budget, average math and reading scores per school, and the overall average scores.

## Conclusion: 

- Charter schools tend to outperform district schools in terms of average math and reading scores, as well as the percentage of students passing both subjects and the overall passing rate. This conclusion is supported by the higher average scores and passing percentages of charter schools like Cabrera High School, Griffin High School, and Pena High School compared to district schools like Figueroa High School, Hernandez High School, and Rodriguez High School.

- There is a positive correlation between school size and average scores, as well as the percentage of students passing math, reading, and overall. Smaller schools, with fewer than 1000 students, tend to have higher average scores and passing percentages compared to larger schools with more than 2000 students. This can be observed by comparing the performance of schools like Holden High School and Pena High School (smaller schools) with Bailey High School and Rodriguez High School (larger schools).
